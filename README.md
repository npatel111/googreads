# googreads
Sort of a goodreads clone but with google books api

Things to do when I'm done with MVP:
- Refactor code
- Search by other terms? (Just title for now)
-*See list of search results before picking what to add*
- Make it look nice
- Other things goodreads does that would be nice?
- Don't want "searched" to show up in shelves index a bunch of times, or in books/show
