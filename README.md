# googreads
Sort of a goodreads clone but with google books api

Things to do when I'm done with MVP:
-*See list of search results before picking what to add*
- Validations!
- Error messages
- Make it look nice
- What if they add book that already exists?

- Delete view files that don't need to exist
- Refactor code
- Search by other terms? (Just title for now)
- Other things goodreads does that would be nice?
