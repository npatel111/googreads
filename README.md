# googreads
Sort of a goodreads clone but with google books api

Things to do when I'm done with MVP:
-*See list of search results before picking what to add*
- Error messages?
- Put methods in models?


- Delete view files that don't need to exist
- Refactor code
- Search by other terms? (Just title for now)
- Add front end
- Add more flash messages for errors:
  - Current on user/edit you have to put correct password and password confirmation to update, but if something goes wrong, would be nice to have an error message
-Make current_user a helper method so we can use it in view
