# googreads
Sort of a goodreads clone but with google books api

Things to do when I'm done with MVP:
- Login stuff
- Refactor code
- Adapter pattern?
-Search by other terms?
-*See list of search results before picking what to add*
- Make it look nice
- Other things goodreads does that would be nice?
- Don't want "searched" to show up in shelves index a bunch of times, or in books/show
